# LSTM Stock Prediction for Assets Benefiting from Pandemic Consumer Surge
I used Keras/TensorFlow to build the long short-term memory model (LSTM) and Matplotlib to visualize the results. 

### Description
Although attempting to use ML methods to predict changes in a stock's value is hardly a novel implementation, I wanted to examine and attempt to predict how stocks for companies that
saw disproportionate quarterly growth due to COVID, specifically Amazon, Zoom and Walmart, performed up to 40 days in the future.
